# Understanding JSON

## What is JSON?

Imagine JSON as a special language that computers use to talk to each other. It's like a secret code that helps them share information in a way that's easy to understand.

## Types of Information JSON Can Hold

JSON can store different types of information, like:

-   Words (called "strings")
-   Numbers
-   True or False (called "booleans")
-   Nothing (called "null")

## How JSON is Used

JSON is like a universal language that many programming languages can understand. This means that different programs can easily share information with each other, even if they're written in different languages.

## Example of JSON

Here's an example of JSON that describes characters from the anime "Bocchi the Rock!":

```json
[
	{
		"Character Name": "Gotoh, Hitori",
		"Age": 15,
		"Hair Color": "Pink"
	},
	{
		"Character Name": "Ikuyo, Kita",
		"Age": 15,
		"Hair Color": "Red"
	},
	{
		"Character Name": "Ijichi, Nijika",
		"Age": 16,
		"Hair Color": "Yellow"
	},
	{
		"Character Name": "Yamada, Ryo",
		"Age": 16,
		"Hair Color": "Blue"
	}
]
```

In this example, each character is represented as an object with properties like "Character Name," "Age," and "Hair Color." The square brackets `[]` indicate that this is a list of objects.
