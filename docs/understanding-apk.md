# Understanding APK

## What is APK?

Imagine APK as a box full of building blocks and instructions. These blocks and instructions are everything needed to run an app on your Android device. Just like building a toy from a box, your phone uses the APK to build and run the app you want to use.

## How APK is Used

When you download an app from the Google Play Store, you're essentially getting an APK file. Your phone then unpacks this box and uses the instructions inside to put all the pieces of the app together. This allows you to play games, watch videos, or do whatever the app is designed to do.

## APK Example

Let's peek inside the "Piano Tiles 2" APK box as an example. Here's a simplified view of what you might find:

-   **AndroidManifest.xml:** This file acts like a table of contents, telling your phone what the app is called, what it does, and what other files it needs.
-   **classes.dex:** This file contains the actual code that makes the app work, like the instructions for playing music and responding to your touch.
-   **resources.arsc:** This file holds all the images, sounds, and other resources that the app needs to look and sound good.
-   **assets:** This folder contains additional resources like fonts and images that the app might need.
-   **res:** This folder holds various resources specific to different screen sizes and languages.
