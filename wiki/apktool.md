# Apktool

`Apktool` is a handy tool for reverse engineering Android applications. Here's a quick guide on how to use it:

## Prerequisites

-   **Java:** `Apktool` requires Java to run. Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can check by opening a command prompt and typing `java -version`. If you don't have it, you can download it from the official Java website https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp.

## Installing Apktool

There are two ways to install `Apktool`:

1. **Pre-built binary:** Download the latest `Apktool` release from the official website https://apktool.org/. This will provide a pre-built binary file that you can directly use.

2. **Build from source:** If you're comfortable compiling from source, you can clone the `Apktool` repository from GitHub and build it yourself. Instructions are available on the `Apktool` website.

## Basic Usage

`Apktool` has two main functions: decompiling and recompiling APK files.

-   **Decompiling:** This extracts the contents of an APK file into a readable format, allowing you to see the application's resources (layouts, images, strings), code (smali), and manifest file.

```bash
apktool d "<apk_file>" "<output_directory>"
```

Replace `<apk_file>` with the path to your APK file and `<output_directory>` with the directory where you want the decompiled files to be saved.

-   **Recompiling:** This takes the decompiled files (usually modified) and rebuilds them into a working APK file.

```bash
apktool b "<source_directory>" "<output_apk>"
```

Replace `<source_directory>` with the directory containing the decompiled files and `<output_apk>` with the desired name for the rebuilt APK file.

::: warning

Modifying and recompiling APKs can be risky. Understand the potential consequences before making changes. Use `Apktool` responsibly for ethical hacking and app development purposes.
